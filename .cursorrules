# Cursor AI Assistant Rules for TradeManthan Project

## Command Execution Guidelines

### Timeout Requirements
- ALWAYS use `timeout` command for potentially blocking operations:
  - `tail -f` or `tail` on log files
  - `grep` on large files
  - `ssh` commands that might hang
  - Any command that waits for output

### Examples:
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - with timeout
timeout 5 tail -10 /tmp/uvicorn.log
timeout 10 ssh ... "command"
timeout 3 grep pattern file.log

# ❌ WRONG - no timeout
tail -10 /tmp/uvicorn.log
ssh ... "command"
grep pattern file.log
```

### Deployment Commands
- Use the API endpoint `/scan/deploy-backend` for deployments (fast, non-blocking)
- If using SSH directly, always include timeout wrapper
- Never use `tail -f` without timeout in deployment scripts

### Log Checking
- Always use timeout when checking logs via SSH
- Prefer API endpoints for status checks when available
- Use `timeout 5` for quick log checks, `timeout 10` for longer operations
